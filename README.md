# Email-Django

This app is an email-type website where users can create an email under any domain name. Then, they have the option to send, view, archive and reply to incoming emails on the app. I was given the backend along with an API that I had to use for the frontend. The backend is django and the frontend is made using javascript.

It is hosted on aws here: http://ec2-13-49-69-106.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/
