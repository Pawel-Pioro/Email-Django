# Email-Django

This app is an email-type website where users can create an email under any domain name. Then, they have the option to send, view, archive and reply to incoming emails on the app. I was given the backend along with an API that I had to use to make the frontend. 

The backend is Django and the frontend is made using JavaScript.
